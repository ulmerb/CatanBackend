How to run the app:

1) in One tab: cd to the CatanBackend folder and run the following command: 
to get a python server on port 8000:
“python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000”

2) Open a new tab and in the same folder CatanBackend run the command: mongod
to get mongo db running (obviously you should install mongo locally.
If you don’t have mongoldb already here is a useful link to install it:
https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-enterprise-on-os-x/

3) Enter the following directory: /CatanBackend/frontEnd/project7/
and run the following command: node loadDatabase.js

and then run the command: nodemon

4) Now enter the following directory:
/CatanBackend/frontEnd/project7
within it you will find the file: photo-share.html
now you can open it in your local browser.
